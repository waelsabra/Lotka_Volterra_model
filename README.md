# Lotka_Volterra_model
## The Lotka-Volterra model is a mathematical framework originally developed by Alfred Lotka and Vito Volterra to describe ecological dynamics. The model utilises a system of differential equations to simulate the temporal progression of two interacting populations, such as bacterial species. Within the domain of microbiology, this model can elucidate the influence of competitive or symbiotic relationships between bacterial strains on their growth. The prediction of the behaviour of two populations is achieved through the variation of certain parameters within the model. These parameters include the growth rate, the carrying capacity of the environment (media), the initial concentrations of each population, and the interaction parameter (the interspecies competition rate of one microbe on the other).The model has been developed to facilitate the visualisation of these oscillations and dependencies, thereby offering insight into microbial balance and competition in environments such as the gut, soil, or bioreactors.
